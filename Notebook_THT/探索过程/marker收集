### 上皮细胞注释
WE inroduce defined epithelial markers, EPCAM, SFN, and all expressed cytokeratins for CD45− cells
to identify epithelial cells. For each CD45− cluster, we calculated the average
normalized expression level of the epithelial marker gene set and expressed as
epithelial score. The clusters were ordered by epithelial scores and a significant
drop between epithelial and non-epithelial clusters was seen. We defined a robust
epithelial score threshold as 10 for epithelial clusters.

### 亚群注释
Subclustering of epithelial
cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, T cells, B cells and myeloid cells was further
performed with the same approach as CD45- and CD45+ cells. For epithelial cells,
tumor samples (N= 52) with >100 epithelial cells were retained for subclustering.
For T-cell specific clustering, we additionally removed genes related to general cell
stress, type I Interferon (IFN) response and cell cycle as previously suggested41. The
contaminating immune cells in CD45- dataset and nonimmune cells in CD45+
dataset were removed prior to clustering on the basis of their expression patterns.
T cells with expression of both CD4 and CD8A/B were considered as unresolved
T cells, which were not included in downstream analysis.

         "PPL","SPRR3"],
}

### 2大类-免疫细分为B,T,髓系,ILC?
T细胞:<br>
CD2是早期的T细胞marker,广泛表达于T,NK,部分B和单核<br>
CD3和TCR形成CD3-TCR复合物<br>
TRAC是编码T细胞受体（TCR）α链恒定区的基因<br>
TRBC2 编码TCR β链

B细胞
CD19存在于自原始B细胞（Progenitor B cell）后期以后的各阶段，包括浆细胞。(好像T细胞也有表达?)<br>
CD79A和CD79B编码的蛋白和BCR形成复合物<br>
MS4A1(CD20)在B细胞的活化和信号转导中有重要作用<br>
JCHAIN J链把IGA和IGM的单体连接在一起<br>
MZB1 marginal zone B and B1 cell specific protein Gene<br>

髓系

"Myeloids":["LYZ","CD14","GCA","HPGDS","CD68","IL3RA","LAMP3",
            "CLEC4C","TPSAB1"],

## 大类总结
marker_genes = {

"Fib": ["DCN","COL1A1","COL1A2","FN1","COL3A1","COL6A1"],
"Endo" : ["VWF","PECAM1","ENG","CDH5"],

"Myeloids":["LYZ","CD14","GCA","HPGDS","CD68","IL3RA","LAMP3","CLEC4C","TPSAB1"],
}
比较搞不太清的是髓系到底有没有一个共同的marker,还有就是ILC
