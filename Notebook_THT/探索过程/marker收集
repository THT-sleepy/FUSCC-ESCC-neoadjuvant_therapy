### 上皮细胞注释
WE inroduce defined epithelial markers, EPCAM, SFN, and all expressed cytokeratins for CD45− cells
to identify epithelial cells. For each CD45− cluster, we calculated the average
normalized expression level of the epithelial marker gene set and expressed as
epithelial score. The clusters were ordered by epithelial scores and a significant
drop between epithelial and non-epithelial clusters was seen. We defined a robust
epithelial score threshold as 10 for epithelial clusters.

### 亚群注释
Subclustering of epithelial
cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, T cells, B cells and myeloid cells was further
performed with the same approach as CD45- and CD45+ cells. For epithelial cells,
tumor samples (N= 52) with >100 epithelial cells were retained for subclustering.
For T-cell specific clustering, we additionally removed genes related to general cell
stress, type I Interferon (IFN) response and cell cycle as previously suggested41. The
contaminating immune cells in CD45- dataset and nonimmune cells in CD45+
dataset were removed prior to clustering on the basis of their expression patterns.
T cells with expression of both CD4 and CD8A/B were considered as unresolved
T cells, which were not included in downstream analysis.
